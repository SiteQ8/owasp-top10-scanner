- **Professional Reporting**: JSON export and colored terminal output
- **Multi-threaded Scanning**: Efficient concurrent vulnerability testing

### OWASP Top 10 2021 Implementation
✅ A01: Broken Access Control - Directory enumeration and unauthorized access testing
✅ A02: Cryptographic Failures - SSL/TLS configuration and encryption analysis  
✅ A03: Injection - SQL injection and XSS vulnerability detection
✅ A04: Insecure Design - Design flaw identification (basic implementation)
✅ A05: Security Misconfiguration - Missing headers and server disclosure
✅ A06: Vulnerable Components - Outdated service and software detection
✅ A07: Authentication Failures - Weak authentication mechanism testing
✅ A08: Data Integrity Failures - Insecure data handling checks
✅ A09: Logging/Monitoring Failures - Insufficient logging detection
✅ A10: SSRF - Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability testing
